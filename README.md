# General Notes/Things to Improve On - Landing Page Project

## NavBar
*  Websites tend to have margin/padding to the side to give space to their elements

## Hero Section/Blue
* Button will look sort of weird when flex direction is column
    * Adjustment of padding needed I believe
* Text wrap needs improvement
* Need to have a better understanding on the spacing between two objects with text in one of them

## Infro/Picture Section
* Picture with border has some weird gap in them when zooming in website

## Quote Section
* Quote Identifer may need to have better spacing

## Call to action section
* Better control of spacing needed

# Overall things to work on
* Better understanding of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis needed
* Text wrap/flex wrap needed a better understanding
* Websites have their elements "padded in", space on the sides of the page
